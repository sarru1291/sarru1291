<p>
  I'm a Software Engineer with 2 years of professional experience turning coffee into clean code. Skilled at crafting responsive, user-friendly web apps using modern tools like React/Next.js on the front end and Node.js or Spring on the back. Fluent in Java, JavaScript, MongoDB, SQLâ€”and just as comfortable navigating a Linux terminal as writing shell scripts in it.

Outside of building apps, I've tackled a range of freelance projects: from creating full-stack solutions to writing Linux tutorials and technical docs that even beginners can follow. Whether it's debugging a tricky API or explaining cron jobs to humans, Iâ€™m all about making tech workâ€”and make sense.
